# UK-Retail-Commercial-Analysis: Turning Data into Actionable Insights
Hi!
- My name is Filzah, and this is my portfolio created for my Data Science Bootcamp's Final Project.
- In this portfolio, you can see the coding (Python) analysis I have done. 
- If there is any interest in working with me, please connect with me via filzahann@gmail.com

Certainly, I'd be happy to help you create a pitch for your Upwork profile that outlines the goals of your project, what you did in terms of analysis, methods, techniques, and a summary of the project's success. Here's a draft you can use as a starting point:

🎯 **Project Goals:** 
I specialize in extracting actionable insights from data, and my recent project exemplifies this. The primary goals were to enhance customer segmentation, analyze customer behaviours, and implement a state-of-the-art recommendation system. The overarching aim was to boost revenue and user satisfaction.

🔍 **What I Did:**
- *Customer Segmentation*: Employed K-means clustering, a robust unsupervised machine learning technique, to categorize customers based on their historical data, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies more effectively.

- *Customer Analysis*: Utilized RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores to gain in-depth insights into customer behaviours, helping businesses understand and predict trends in customer purchasing.

- *Recommendation System*: Implemented collaborative filtering, a sophisticated machine learning approach, to build a personalized recommendation system. This system not only enhanced user experience but also led to a substantial increase in revenue.

🛠️ **Techniques Applied:**
- **K-means Clustering:** To segment customers based on their behaviour.
- **RFM Scores:** For customer analysis and predicting purchasing trends.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** To develop a recommendation system, enhancing both user experience and revenue generation.

🌟 **Project Success:**
The project was a resounding success, delivering tangible results:
- Improved customer segmentation led to a more personalized approach, increasing conversion rates.
- In-depth customer analysis allowed for the prediction of purchasing trends and tailored marketing campaigns.
- The recommendation system dramatically improved the user experience and contributed significantly to revenue growth, with up to 45% of eCommerce revenues attributed to product recommendations based on Amazon research.
